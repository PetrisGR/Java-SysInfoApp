## Description

"Java-SysInfoApp" is a beginner-friendly project for collecting basic system information. Designed as one of my initial college assignments, this Java application explores operating system, network, and storage basic details.

## Features

- **Operating System Information:** Displays details about the operating system, including manufacturer, name, version, and architecture.
- **Network Information:** Shows current online status, ISP provider, location (including region and country), public and local IP addresses, MAC address, and subnet mask.
- **Storage Information:** Lists details about all connected disks (including disk letter, description and total, free, and used space) and provides insights into RAM capacity, available, and used space.
- **File Metadata Check:** Includes a file metadata checker which includes metadata like name, type, size, attributes, and timestamps.
